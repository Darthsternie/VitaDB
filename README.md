# PSPDB Project

PSPDB (Originally called VitaDB) is an opensource project started on March 2017 by Developer Rinnegatamante which aims to build a fully responsive website to handle a generic database with an "appstore-like" look.
I built PSPDB on top of his work and modified the Texts and guides to fit for the PSP.
To achieve these goals, PSPDB currently uses AngularJS framework, a MySQL database and some PHP scripts which handle the backend connection between the frontend website and the real database.

## How to setup PSPDB for your own Store Frontend:

You need a Webserver that supports PHP and MySQL.
For a simple configuration just add your MySQL Configuration to the config.php file.
